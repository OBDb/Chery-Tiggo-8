    description: "The Chery Tiggo 8 is a mid-size crossover SUV that serves as the flagship of Chery's SUV lineup in many markets. The exterior design features a bold front fascia with a large hexagonal grille, sleek LED headlights, and a relatively conservative but modern profile. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 145-156 HP or a 1.6L turbocharged engine with approximately 197 HP, paired with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Most variants feature front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive available in select markets. The interior offers three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, with a modern design featuring a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a digital instrument cluster in higher trims, and available leather upholstery. Technology features include smartphone integration, 360-degree camera systems, and driver assistance features on premium trims. A significant update introduced the Tiggo 8 Pro and Tiggo 8 Plus variants around 2020-2021, featuring more upscale styling with an updated grille design, enhanced interior materials, and additional technology features. Some markets also received plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variants combining a gasoline engine with electric motors for improved efficiency and performance. The Tiggo 8 represents Chery's ambitions in the competitive mid-size SUV segment, offering three-row practicality and modern features at a value-oriented price point as part of the company's international expansion strategy."
